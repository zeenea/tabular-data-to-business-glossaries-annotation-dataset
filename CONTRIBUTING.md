# How To Contribute

### If your contribution concerns :
* Extending the collected datasets
* Extending the business-glossaries
* Extending the Alignments
* Updating the prompt to generate new business glossaries
* Updating the prompt to align the tabular data to the business glossary entities
* Proposing a method to do the alignments using LLMs or another method

### Then you should:
Send us a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done. 
Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:
```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
>
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```


Thanks!
