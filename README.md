# tabular-data-to-business-glossaries-annotation-dataset
A dataset of tabular data from [data.gov](https://data.gov/) annotated to business glossaries using LLMs.

# Dataset Description
Following a collaboration between [Zeenea](https://zeenea.com/fr/) and [LIP6](https://www.lip6.fr/) through an industrial thesis project on **Smart Metadata Management Systems**,
we encountered a number of data-related challenges.
Through this project, we took the initiative to build a relevant dataset for tabular data alignment with business glossaries.

This repository contains tabular data (datasets and columns) collected from [data.gov](https://data.gov/) , various business glossaries, and alignments between tabular data and business glossary entities.

We choose [data.gov](https://data.gov/) for the following reasons:
* Easy-to-use API
* A vast amount of public and open source data
* Tabular Datasets are annotated with _themes_ and a _list of tags_ 
* Tabular Columns have meaningful names 

The table bellow describe the main content of this repository:

| Content Description  |                                                        |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| data/                | Collection of tables in csv files                      |
| metadata/            | Metadata about Datasets, Columns, Themes and Tags      |
| business-glossaries/ | Collection of business-glossaries in csv files         |
| alignments/          | Column and Dataset alignments with business-glossaries |

We used Large Language Models LLMs to assist the dataset construction as described bellow.

# Dataset Construction

We collected 226 Datasets (Tables) from [data.gov](https://data.gov/) using their API, 
by searching for datasets related to "**Transport**" field (The choice of the field was arbitrary).



### LLM-Generated Business Glossaries


### LLM-Generated Alignments
