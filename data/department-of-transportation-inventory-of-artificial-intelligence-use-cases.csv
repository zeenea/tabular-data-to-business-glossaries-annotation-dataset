17,Course Deviation Identification for Multiple Airport Route Separation (MARS),Department of Transportation,Federal Aviation Administration,Aviation Safety (AVS),"The Multiple Airport Route Separation (MARS) program is developing a safety case for reduced separation standards between Performance Based Navigation (PBN) routes in terminal airspace. These new standards may enable deconfliction of airports in high-demand metropolitan areas, including the Northeast Corridor (NEC), North Texas, and Southern California. To build necessary collision risk models for the safety case, several models are needed, including one that describes the behavior of aircraft that fail to navigate the procedure correctly. These events are very rare and difficult to identify with standard data sources. Prior work has used Machine Learning to filter incident data to identify similar events on departure procedures.",Planned (not in production),,"Python in Jupyter Labs, ML, NLP",Yes,Agency Generated,No,,Yes,No,,Yes,Yes,"CEDAR MORs/EORs, Pilot Deviation Reports",False,Sensitive communications.
