In the FY 2005-2010 CIP, the County Council approved a level of effort funding for the outyears of this project in order to adequately illustrate that this project will continue for the foreseeable future.  Funds approved in FYs 2006-2010 were used to address indoor air quality issues systemwide.   Due to fiscal constraints, the County Council's adopted FY 2011-2016 CIP reduced the expenditures, as requested in the Board of Education's FY 2011-2016 CIP for FYs 2012-2016 by approximately $2.8 million.

These additional classrooms would meet capacity requirements under the Subdivision Staging Policy, avoiding a residential moratorium in the Northwood Cluster.  The County Council anticipates that ultimately, the Board of Education will request a specific project that will add, at least, these classrooms and these funds would be used towards that purpose.  On October 13, 2016, Supplement B - Superintendent's Recommendation for the Walter Johnson Cluster Schools, was released and included the recommendation that a study be conducted to address the overutilization at the high school level in the Walter Johnson Cluster as well as all of the high schools in the Downcounty Consortium.  The Board of Education, on November 21, 2016 included Bethesda-Chevy Chase and Walt Whitman high schools as part of the study.  Therefore, the Board of Education's Requested FY 2018 Capital Budget and Amendments to the FY 2017-2022 CIP includes an expenditure shift of one year for this project and it is anticipated that a recommendation to address the overutilization will be included in the FY 2019-2024 CIP. The County Council, in the adopted FY 2017-2022 Amended CIP increased the expenditures in this project and the number of classrooms from 10 to 16 in order to avoid residential moratorium.

46,2020,P316222,ALARF: MCG,"The Advance Land Acquisition Revolving Fund (ALARF) was established to support the implementation of capital project and facility programs in the County. Acquisition of land in advance of actual construction saves money in the face of rising land prices and enables suitable locations for libraries, fire stations, and similar facilities to be secured before development eliminates choice and forces acceptance of a less accessible or desirable site. The revolving fund works in the following way: the unencumbered revolving appropriation balance in the fund is used to purchase land for various public facilities which are either approved in the capital program or which appear in adopted area master plans. Later, the Fund is reimbursed by appropriations to the specific facility project accounts; then, the associated expenditures are transferred from the ALARF project to the facility project, thereby freeing up the appropriation for future expenditures. The reimbursement is desirable for accounting purposes in order to make the cost of the site clearly a part of the total cost of a specific project. Reimbursement also maintains the balance in the revolving fund. A number of such reimbursements are scheduled in this capital program. Cost estimates are not given for possible acquisitions since any estimates would be speculative. Immediately prior to initiating acquisition proceedings on any site, independent professional appraisals are prepared. When projected land costs appear to be considerably greater than anticipated, consultation with the County Council is useful. In the event the County Executive proceeds with advance land acquisition in years before those shown on project description forms, consultation with Council would be useful. The cumulative appropriation is the amount of the revolving fund, as well as certain special appropriations to this project as described below. Costs shown for prior years include the land acquisition reimbursable to the fund and other charges incurred in site selection, such as appraisal, legal costs, and other required actions. Also displayed are expenditures associated with special appropriations, not to be reimbursed. The nonreimbursable amounts are considered sunk costs. Expenditures portrayed above in FY19-24 are for fiscal planning purposes only and represent land acquisition not shown on applicable individual CIP project description forms in order to preserve confidentiality of estimates and negotiations with landowners. ALARF acquisitions are typically reimbursed by appropriations from projects with various revenue sources.",,Ongoing,1,,,,,
